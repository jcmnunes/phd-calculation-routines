# Calculation routines to model plasmid permeation in membrane processes
> Set of Matlab/GNU Octave calculation routines developed during my PhD

This repository contains some of the calculation routines I developed during my PhD. Specifically, this set contains three major functions:

- [np_pdna_3c.m](np_pdna_3c.m)
- [np_rna_3c.m](np_rna_3c.m)
- [np_4c.m](np_4c.m)

These are responsible for the integration of the Nernst-Planck equations (defined in [nernst3c.m](./nernst3c.m) and [nernst4c.m](./nernst4c.m)) for an ionic system with 3 components (pDNA and 2 salt ions), an ionic system with 3 components (RNA and 2 salt ions) and an ionic system with 4 components (pDNA(sc), RNA and 2 salt ions).
